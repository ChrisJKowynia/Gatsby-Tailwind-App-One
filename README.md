This is a react app that uses gatsby and tailwind.

I am goign to dispay the core functionality of these tools and use git and GitHub for versioning.

I will allso use netlify to hot this site.

!! Commits to the master branch in the GitHub repo will automaitiacly cause Netlify to rebuild the site.
